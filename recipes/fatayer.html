    <h1>Authentic Homemade Fatayer (Spinach and Cheese)</h1>
    <img src="https://www.hungrypaprikas.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fatayer-Final-1.jpg" alt="Spinach and Cheese Fatayer">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fatayer are savoury pies, typically stuffed with either a meat filling, spinach, or cheese. The meat filling resembles that of Lahm Bi Ajeen but its shaped into small hand pies. This recipe is for the spinach and cheese, and they're both really easy to make. You may also know of a related dish called Manakish, which are also savoury pies but are presented in a flat shape similar to a pizza.</p>
    <p>The spinach fatayer, also known as fatayer bi sabanekh in Arabic, are really tangy and flavourful with a wonderful depth from the caramelized onions. The cheese ones, which are known as fatayer bi jibneh, have a delicious mixture of creaminess, stretchy-ness and the flavour from the nigella seeds makes them extra special!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2.5 cups all-purpose flour + 2 tablespoons divided into 1 cup and 1.5 cups, measured using a spoon and levelled off flat</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>250 grams fresh mozzarella</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Start by preheating your oven to 375F
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix together the warm water and yeast in a bowl and set aside for 2 minutes to proof
        </li>
        <li>
            In a bowl, add 1 cup of the flour (not all of it), the sugar, and the water and yeast mixture. Mix together well, then cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 10 minutes (you can move on to the filling at this point)
        </li>
        <li>
            After 10 minutes, the mixture will look a bit bubbly. Add to it the rest of the flour (1.5 cups), the olive oil, and the salt and mix well using your spoon to bring the dough together
        </li>
        <li>
            Then use your hands to knead the dough for 5-7 minutes and bring it together. It will be a soft dough and slightly sticky (which will give us that fluffy texture) so you can add the extra 2 tablespoons of flour as you knead it. Feel free to do this step in a stand mixer and a dough hook as well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the dough in an oiled bowl and cover. Allow it to rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Punch down the dough and shape into equal sized balls. I weighed out roughly 40g per dough ball using a kitchen scale, but you can eye this if you like. Cover the balls and allow them to proof for another 10-15 minutes before shaping
        </li>
    </ol>
