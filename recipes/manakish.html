    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Manakish (also pronouned as Manaeesh) is a Lebanese pizza or flatbread made with a soft dough and topped with various toppings, the most common of which is Za'atar and cheese. It can be made into small circular rounds or larger ones depending on preference.</p>
    <p>It's typically made fresh for breakfast and served with fresh vegetables and tea. You can have either cheese only manakish, Za'atar only manakish, or you can even mix the two. Other toppings include labneh (a soft yogurt cheese) and sausage with cheese, as well as a ground beef mixture similar to Lahm Bi Ajeen. Manakish are a flat style of savoury middle eastern pie, similar to Fatayer but those are more like hand pies.</p>
